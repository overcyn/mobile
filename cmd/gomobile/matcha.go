Bind generates language bindings for the package named by the import
path, and compiles a library for the named target system.

The -target flag takes a target system name, either android (the
default) or ios.

For -target android, the bind command produces an AAR (Android ARchive)
file that archives the precompiled Java API stub classes, the compiled
shared libraries, and all asset files in the /assets subdirectory under
the package directory. The output is named '<package_name>.aar' by
default. This AAR file is commonly used for binary distribution of an
Android library project and most Android IDEs support AAR import. For
example, in Android Studio (1.2+), an AAR file can be imported using
the module import wizard (File > New > New Module > Import .JAR or
.AAR package), and setting it as a new dependency
(File > Project Structure > Dependencies).  This requires 'javac'
(version 1.7+) and Android SDK (API level 15 or newer) to build the
library for Android. The environment variable ANDROID_HOME must be set
to the path to Android SDK. The generated Java class is in the java
package 'go.<package_name>' unless -javapkg flag is specified.

By default, -target=android builds shared libraries for all supported
instruction sets (arm, arm64, 386, amd64). A subset of instruction sets
can be selected by specifying target type with the architecture name. E.g.,
-target=android/arm,android/386.

For -target ios, gomobile must be run on an OS X machine with Xcode
installed. Support is not complete. The generated Objective-C types
are prefixed with 'Go' unless the -prefix flag is provided.

For -target android, the -bootclasspath and -classpath flags are used to
control the bootstrap classpath and the classpath for Go wrappers to Java
classes.

The -v flag provides verbose output, including the list of packages built.

The build flags -a, -n, -x, -gcflags, -ldflags, -tags, and -work
are shared with the build command. For documentation, see 'go help build'.
